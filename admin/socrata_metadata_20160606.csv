Notes:								
1) Enrolments are full-time equivalent (FTE) enrolments. For the purposes of State reporting, only students in Year 11 and 12 may be part-time. Hence there is no difference between ""full-time"" and ""full-time equivalent"" enrolments for K-10 or ungraded in NSW government schools.								
2) Ungraded students are students who are not assigned to a particular grade.  They are often enrolled in support classes or schools for specific purposes (SSPs)								
3) Total enrolments are provided for Schools for Specific Purposes.  All these students are classified as ungraded students.								
4) sp: data suppressed where enrolments are 5 or fewer. Where only one grade at a school had a value of <=5, the ungraded cell has also been suppressed for privacy reasons.
